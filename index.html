  <p>I ended up changing the website a little bit to something I may want to use later. I spent a decent amount of time centering the background and squares that sit on top of it. I haven't really editted the text as it doesn't always display exactly where I want it to. Other than that I added a header and this paragraph and made sure it sits on top of the backgrounds.</p>
