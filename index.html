Hi Rachel! I included a note on the CSS sheet I made before
realizing view source will not let you see that. The comment just
gave credit to this website
https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/
which I used fairly extensively to guide my style sheet to centering
my background image.

<h1 id=thisIs>This is a header</h1>

<div id=back3>
  <img src="assets/back3.jpg" alt="background"></img>
</div>
<div id=back4>
  <img src="assets/back4.jpg" alt="back4"></img>
  <p>I ended up changing the website a little bit to something I may want to use later. I spent a decent amount of time centering the background and squares that sit on top of it. I haven't really editted the text as it doesn't always display exactly where I want it to. Other than that I added a header and this paragraph and made sure it sits on top of the backgrounds. I also included a citation as a comment in the HTML.</p>
</div id=back4>
